lowkey don't wanna make this pretty uhmmmmmm

- I am brazilian therefore english isnt my native language and I WILL make mistakes. You're free to correct me just be nice bruh

- I am very socially awkward and anxious, I also tend not to talk to people if they aren't my friends/I don't consider them close so please always iwc

- Sometimes I'll be as offline if I don't feel okay or If I feel uncomfortable and I forget to turn it back on so yeah

- I make kms/kys jokes and am rude/mean jokingly, I rarely use tonetags though I do rely on them, feel free to ask for me to use them

- I make some weird jokes (nothing sexual) so please tell me if they make you uncomfortable. Most people in the PHIGHTING/Roblox area know me from my joke skins and weird stuff

- I am most of the time in the PHIGHTING!/Roblox area but might sometimes sit somewhere else with a friend

- I am not an irl nor a system, any ponies that have 'me' on the name are fictionkins / I have the same personality as the character or are a joke

- I always have one of my githubs linked (this one, elster-unit or touden-sibIings) unless it's a joke skin PLEASE STOP COPYING MY SKINS. they aren't even good bruh
