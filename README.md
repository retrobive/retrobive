I don't have a style, I just do whatever I think looks cool. My main inspo is my sibling, @love-bullet.

  ► Socially awkward and anxious, might now initiate conversations if we aren't close. I also make kys/kms jokes and am rude/mean jokingly.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
► Pretty much always at PHIGHTING!/Roblox area, unless I'm sitting somewhere else with my friends.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
► Please don't make 'I'm gonna touch you' or 'You're fat/big' jokes with me unless you're a close friend of mine, as they make me uncomfortable when coming from a stranger/someone I'm not close with.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
► Please also do avoid using typing quirks while talking to me, they make it quite hard for me to read. I'm afk most of the time, if not I'm probably making skins, meaning I most likely can't type.
  </p>

► My game also lags/crashes/freezes a lot so PLEASE w2i if you want an answer, as I might miss the messag due to lag or whatever..
