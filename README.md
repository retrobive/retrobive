It ' s 　just 　what 　you 　did 　.

  ► Socially awkward and anxious ,, I prefer not to talk to people I'm not friends with .. I make kys/kms jokes and am rude/mean jokingly .. I make a lot of typos and misread often and am a bit slow ,, please be patient with me 
</p> 
</p>
<p align="center">
► Pretty much always at PHIGHTING!/Roblox area unless I'm sitting somewhere else with my friends ,, I always have this github ,, azuresz or touden-sibIings linked unless it's a joke skin .
</p>
<p align="center">
  ► Please don't make 'I'm gonna touch you' or 'You're fat/big' jokes with me as they make me uncomfortable ,, please also do avoid using typing quirks while talking to me .. they make it hard for me to read .
