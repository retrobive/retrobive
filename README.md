It ' s 　just 　what 　you 　did 　.

Side note; I don't have a style, I just do whatever I think looks cool. I also don't take inspo from anyone in specific. My main inspo is my sibling, @love-bullet.

<p align="center">
  ► Socially awkward and anxious ,, I prefer not to talk to people I'm not friends with . I make kys/kms jokes and am rude/mean jokingly . I make a lot of typos and misread often and am a bit slow ,, please be patient with me .
</p> 
<p align="center">
 ► I am very forgetful .  I'll probably forget who you are unless we're close ,, will also forget important things (like your pronouns/name - unless I have a friend note for you - or stuff you've told me..) .  My status is always set on online ,, otherwise I am afk . Please always whisper 2 interact !
</p>
<p align="center">
► Pretty much always at PHIGHTING!/Roblox area unless I'm sitting somewhere else with my friends ,, I always have this github ,, divine-resurrection or the-dreamsphere linked unless it's a joke skin .
</p>
<p align="center">
  ► Please don't make 'I'm gonna touch you' or 'You're fat/big' jokes with me as they make me uncomfortable ,, please also do avoid using typing quirks while talking to me . They make it hard for me to read .
</p>
<p align="center">
 ► I am afk most of the time ,, and if I'm not afk I'm probably making skins ,, meaning I most likely can't type ,, again ,, whisper 2 interact . My game also lags/crashes/freezes a lot so PLEASE w2i if you want an answer as I might miss the messag due to lag or whatever ..
